<!-- NOTES -->

- https://reactnative.dev/docs/intro-react-native-components#core-components
- https://reactnative.dev/docs/ (VERY IMPORTANT)
- In react native, button are self closing tags and receive props such as title, onPress, etc. but they do not take in style prop
- Go to the api reference for a particular rn tag to see more information about the props you can use and how they work. Good advice.

<!-- ISSUES AND FIXES -->

- In FlatList, item must be destructure (({})) not (())
